# Open Digital Frame

**Software to create a digital photo frame: browse image directories and do slideshows with image panning and cropping on-the-fly**

Open Digital Frame is a collection of Python programs and shell 
scripts to turn a GNU/Linux box into a digital photo frame. It 
was developed on a Raspberry Pi version 2, so it should run 
smoothly on very low-end hardware.

It consists mainly of two programs: **open-digital-frame** and 
**photo-reframe**. The first is a directory browser, where the 
directories are listed into a scrollable window, each with its 
thumbnail and title. The thumbnail is taken from a _folder.jpg_ 
file and some metadata are read from a _folder.nfo_ file.

If a directory contains a **playlist.m3u** file and its 
thumbnail is selected, the **photo-reframe** program is started. 
This program will display each image listed into the playlist, 
performing panning and zooming on the fly as instructed by the 
playlist itself.

The directory browser **open-digital-frame** can be configured 
as an autostart program, it is also possible to configure a 
playlist as an autoplay item, so that a slideshow can start 
automatically when you turn on the system.

## Additiona Debian packages required

Open Digital Frame was tested on the **Raspberry Pi OS with desktop**,
Debian version 12 Bookworm, release date December 5th 2023. Some 
additional packages are required, install them as root or using 
sudo:

```
apt install python3-pyqt5 exiv2
```

## The directory folder.nfo file

The directory browser of Open Digital Frame searches for a 
**folder.nfo** file into each subdirectory. The file is a simple 
XML file that may contains some tags; these tags are used to 
compose the thumbnails screen, to sort items and to select 
playlists to play by tags.

This is an example:

```
<slideshow>
    <title>Libera Universit√† di Alcatraz - Luglio 2012</title>
    <sorttitle>2012_07_16_</sorttitle>
    <tag>Family</tag>
    <tag>Holydays</tag>
    <date>2012-07-16</date>
</slideshow>
```

## The directory thumbnail

If a directory contains a **folder.jpg** or **folder.png**, that 
image is used as a thumbnails into the Open Digital Frame 
directory browser.

## The playlist.m3u file format

The playlist is a text file saved into the directory that
contains the images. The default, preferred name is
**playlist_16x9.m3u**, other names searched for are
**playlist_4x3.m3u** and **playlist.m3u**.

You can set the playlist filename preferences into the
configuration file.

The playlist contains the filename of the images and their
respective geometries, separated by a vertical bar, something
like this:

```
IMG_6602.JPG|4000x2250+0+332
IMG_6605.JPG|2971x1671+796+628
IMG_6606.JPG|4000x2250+0+442
IMG_6610.JPG|3810x2143+90+387
IMG_6615.JPG|2828x1590+547+681
IMG_6617.JPG|1633x918+1229+1052
IMG_6624.JPG|2843x1599+393+585
```

Each geometry determines the portion of the image to be shown in
the slideshow, and it is composed by four values:

* **width** of the crop region
* **height** of the crop region
* **X offset** of the top-left corner of the region
* **Y offset** of the top-left corner of the region

The cropped region is resized to occupy the entire screen.

The playlist file can be created manually, but the preferred way 
is to use the **photo-reframe** program interactively: using a 
keyboard you can cycle through all the images contained into a 
directory, zoom and pan each photo as required and finally save 
the updated playlist. Here it is an example:

```
cd Picture/Holydays
photo-reframe .
```
The keys to use are:

* **F** or **F11**: to toggle full screen
* **+** or **-**: zoom in or out
* **Arrows keys**: pan
* **Return**: confirm the geometry for the current image
* **Space**: move to the next image
* **Backspace**: move to the previous image
* **S**: save the playlist
* **F1**: help on keys function

If you re-run the program, the existing playlist is loaded and 
it is possible to make further changes to it.
